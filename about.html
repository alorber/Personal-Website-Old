        <p> At Cooper Union I am heavily involved in Hillel, the Jewish club on campus. Hillel promotes Jewish culture 
          and holds events for anyone interested in attending. I joined Hillel as the Event Coordinator from Fall 2018 to 
          Fall 2019. As Event Coordinator I managed the logistics to ensure that monthly events ran smoothly for over 
          thirty students and I collaborated with board members to determine a road-map for the semesterâ€™s event 
          programming. From Fall 2019 to Fall 2020, I held the position of Vice President, working with the club's 
          President to lead monthly meetings, finalize event details, and ensure all club programs were properly managed. 
          Currently, until Fall 2021, I am the President of Hillel.</p>

        <p>This past summer (2021), I interned at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/"><i>Facebook</i></a> as a 
          Front-end Engineering Intern. Over the course of my internship I worked on a new internal tooling experience, 
          bringing all internal tools under one roof with a uniform UI and significantly easier onboarding experience. 
          While migrating each internal tool to the new experience, I was able to interact with and collaborate with many 
          teams, engineers, and designers. Additionally, I collaborated closely with another intern on areas in which our 
          projects overlapped. This reduced extraneous work and allowed us to focus on building better React components 
          that could be used by us both and others. Towards the end of the Summer, as I completed my project, I demoed 
          my work to key users in order to incorporate customer feedback into the product. In addition to the work I did 
          on my project, I added logging to most components / interactions on the new experience, and I created a dashboard 
          to view countless stats about the product's usage; this allows the team to make educated decision on what to focus 
          their time on.
        </br></br> Overall, this internship was a great experience. I gained many new technical skills, including industry level 
          React and GraphQl, and I learned a lot about working on a team and collaborating closely with many engineers & 
          product designers.

        <p>Last summer (2020), I returned to <a href="https://cooper.edu/engineering/summer-stem"><i>The Cooper Union 
          Summer STEM program</i></a> as a teaching assistant for the <i>Robotics Crash Course</i>. Due to COVID, the 
          usual six-week course was divided into two three-week sessions of roughly twenty high-schoolers to allow more 
          students to participate. Throughout the course, I, along with three others, directed the students in assembling 
          a car containing an arduino and various sensors and taught the students the necessary software skills in order 
          to program the robot to avoid obstacles. I created presentations and taught classes on Git, GitHub, and various 
          topics in C++. While teaching over video-chat had its challenges, it was a rewarding experience; I, along with my 
          coworkers, were able to cause students who began the course with no engineering experience to complete the course 
          interested in entering the field. Teaching this course allowed me to review the fundamentals of arduino and C++, 
          while researching new topics in order to answer difficult questions asked by students.</p>

        <p>I spent the summer of 2019 at <a href="https://cooper.edu/engineering/summer-stem"><i>The Cooper Union Summer 
          STEM program</i></a> as a teaching assistant for the <i>Computer Science for Social Good</i> course. I, along 
          with three others, developed a six week curriculum to teach twenty-four high school students with no previous 
          programming experience web application development. Throughout the program, I created presentations and taught 
          classes on a range of topics, including JavaScript, React, Firebase, HTML, & CSS. Class time was spent teaching 
          or assisting the six groups of students in designing and creating their web applications that supported one of 
          the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. In order to teach something, one has to truly understand it. 
          This experience has allowed me to learn more, master the fundamentals, and assist a new group of students in 
          building an interest in computer science. 
          </br></br>These two summers of teaching helped me develop important skills: communication, organization, public 
          speaking, leadership, and many more.</p>

        <p>The summer following high school, I interned at <a href="https://www.key.me"><i>KeyMe</i></a> as a front-end developer. I worked 
          on interesting projects consisting of revamping the shopping cart navigation, creating an end-to-end easter 
          egg coupon experience, and more. I learned a lot, including <i>git</i> and <i>Vue</i>, and it was a great 
          experience working there.</p>

          subway and watching Jeopardy at home. I am interested mixology and I am also a second degree black-belt in
