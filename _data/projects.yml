- name: Quadratic Neurons as Activation Functions in Deep Neural Networks
  subtitle: <i>Deep Learning</i> Final Project
  date: Fall 2020
  description: 'Our final project for Deep Learning built upon the work of Yaparla Ganesh and Rhishi Pratap Singh in <i>Pattern 
  Classification using Quadratic Neuron: An Experimental Study</i>. Their paper discusses the use of quadratic (QUAD) neurons to 
  build quadratic neural networks, as opposed to the familiar linear neurons in multilayer perceptron (MLP) models. This paper 
  displays the use of their quadratic neuron as a Quadratic Activation Function. Comparisons are made between the Sigmoid activation, 
  ReLu activation, and two new types of quadratic activations. Extensive experimentation was conducted on toy datasets, such as MNIST, 
  CIFAR10, Spirals, Circles, and more. Empirical results display the use of these Quadratic Activation Functions and motivate further 
  study on the topic.

  The paper we chose was <i>Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks</i> by Chelsea Finn, Pieter Abbeel, 
  and Sergey Levine. The meta-learning algorithm they present allows for a model to train on a wide range of tasks and then 
  be fine-tuned to a specific new task from just a few training examples.

- name: Neural Network
  subtitle: Neural Network for <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> Project
  date: Fall 2019
  description: 'Project 2 of my <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> course was to build a neural network from scratch. 
  The program allows for the training and testing of a neural network containing one hidden layer. The expected 
  outputs for training and testing examples will always be 1 or 0, respectively indicating inclusion or exclusion 
  from some Boolean class.
  <br><br>When the neural network is trained, the program will prompt the user for the names of three text files 
  representing the initial neural network, a training set, and an output file; one positive integer representing 
  the number of epochs; and one floating-point value representing the learning rate. The first text file will 
  specify the number of input nodes, hidden nodes, and output nodes. The training is done using back-propagation.
  <br><br>When the neural network is tested, the program will prompt the user for the names of three 
  text files representing a trained neural network, a testing set, and an output file. Four metrics are calculated 
  for each Boolean output class: Overall Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1. These metrics are also calculated 
  for the entire data-set using mico-averaging and macro-averaging.
  <br><br>Additionally, each student was required to create or find an interesting dataset that can be used 
  to train and test neural networks adhering to the specifications of this assignment. The description of 
  my custom data-set can be read <i><a href="assets/pdf/AI_Project_2_Writeup.pdf">here</a></i>.
  <br><br>The code for the project can be found <i><a href="https://github.com/alorber/AI-Neural_Network">here

- name: Checkers AI
  subtitle: Artificial Intelligence That Plays Checkers
  date: Fall 2019
  description: 'The first project in my <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> course was to build the game of checkers and 
  an AI to play against the user. I built the game with an ASCII interface, allowing the user to select from 
  multiple options and game modes. The user can begin a new game or import a custom board, the user can either 
  play against the AI or have the AI play itself, the user can decide how long the AI has to move, and the user 
  can decide the starting player. The AI was implemented by a minimax search with alpha-beta pruning and 
  iterative deepening. I developed and thoroughly tested the heuristic that the AI uses by having the AI play 
  against itself with different heuristics, tweaking the one that lost.
  <br><br>The code for the project can be found <i><a href="https://github.com/alorber/AI-Checkers">here</a></i>

- name: Guess The Song
  subtitle: Song Guessing Game using the Spotify Web API
  date: Winter 2019
  description: 'I love listening to music and so do my friends. Now and then we would play a game where 
    we would shuffle a playlist on Spotify and see who could guess the song first. I decided to learn backend 
    web development by creating a web version of the game we had been playing mechanically. I learned Node.js and 
    how to work with the Spotify Web API to build <i>Guess The Song</i>. The game requires the user to sign into 
    a premium Spotify account. The user will then decide which playlist to play with and which device they would like 
    to listen on. 
    <br><br>There are two game modes to try: (1) Time Challenge - The user has 60 seconds to score as many 
    points as they can. Points are awarded based on how fast the correct answer is chosen. An incorrect choice will 
    subtract 5 seconds. (2) Classic Mode - The user can see how long they can last before they lose all three lives. 
    Each song will play for 5 seconds before a life is lost.

- name: Don't Break The Ice
  subtitle: Logic Game Built Using CMOS Logic Chips for my <i>Digital Logic Design</i> Final Project
  date: Fall 2018
  description: 'The final project for <i>Digital Logic Design</i> required each group of 2 students to fully design 
    and build a project of their choosing (once the professor approved it) using CMOS logic chips and breadboards. 
    The project my partner and I built is a logic puzzle / maze.
    <br><br>The game plays as follows: The goal is to reach the specified ending position from the specified 
    starting position by stepping on each "tile" on an 8x8 matrix of LEDs once and only once. If the player 
    goes over a "tile" that has already been stepped on, then the player will lose. Since it is possible to 
    have an unplayable board if randomly generated, 4 easy boards and 4 hard boards were created. The player 
    can select the difficulty and one of the 4 board from the selected group will be randomly chosen.

- name: Ramaz Artist Project
  subtitle: Website for High School Art Project
  date: Spring 2017
  description: 'The Ramaz Artist Project was my first experience with web development. During my senior year of 
    high school, one of my teachers asked me if I would like to build a website for a school art project. Realizing 
    the opportunity to learn something new, I immediately agreed. I spent a few weeks watching videos online, which 
    taught me the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; The rest I learned as I worked on the website.
    <br><br> The official description of the project is: <i>The Ramaz Artist Project is an online video series 
    created as a homage to the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s own Artist Project, in which contemporary artists 
    from around the world explore and engage with its renowned collection. The Ramaz Artist Project follows 
    twelve senior studio art students as they vocalize their relationships with the very same body of work.</i>
